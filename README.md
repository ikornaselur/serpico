# Serpico

A CLI tool to run and deploy MicroPython code to Raspberry Pi Pico devices. The
name is a portmanteau of "Serial" and "Pico".

The idea is to have a simple tool to discovery a connected Pico and either run
a script on it or deploy code to it.

Should you use it? Probably not, it's very likely that something like the
[pyboard.py](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/pyboard.py.html)
tool will be much better.

So why make this? Why not? It's always fun to write code in Rust.
